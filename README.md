# SlackComposeMultiplatform

### This is a jetpack compose Slack Client Clone written in Kotlin Multiplatform following clean architecture principles.

Depends on [gRPC-KMP](https://github.com/Anmol92verma/gRPC-KMP) which is a fork for gRPC library by [TimOrtel/GRPC-Kotlin-Multiplatform](https://github.com/TimOrtel/GRPC-Kotlin-Multiplatform)! 

Important Points

EVERYTHING is a MESS! RN, I need to move away modules as git submodules and separate out the dependencies!

1. Install gRPC library on mavenLocal() once you clone [gRPC-KMP](https://github.com/Anmol92verma/gRPC-KMP)
2. Build and install to mavenLocal grpc-multiplatform-lib & plugin module (Note: Use Xcode 13.0 only! 14.0.* doesnt work with grpc!)
3. Import SlackServer in Intellij Idea and run the server.
4. iOS build fails with ref issue. https://github.com/TimOrtel/GRPC-Kotlin-Multiplatform/issues/11

I haven't tried running iOS build for some time it depends a lot on the grpc-kmp library support for iOS
.
Once the gradle sync is successful you need to run the task which deploys the app on simulator. 
There's a specific task to deploy on iPad and iPhones.

`./gradlew iosDeployIPhone8Debug`

Also make sure you use the grpc kmp library from the fork that i created as mentioned above

The android and jvm run's fine, make sure you match the ip address in GrpcCalls class of your system once you run the slackserver module locally!
